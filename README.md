### Machine Learning with PySpark: Recommender Systems

### Task 1: Set Up the Project Environment

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Storing **secret keys** in a `.env` file enhances security and reduces the risk of data breaches.
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is crucial for dimensionality reduction, helping retain as much information as possible while simplifying data.

### Task 2: Prepare the Dataset

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - `concat_ws` in PySpark concatenates multiple input columns into a single string column, aiding in effective preprocessing.
  - Combining **titles** and **descriptions** before extracting embedding vectors ensures comprehensive product representations.
  - **Text embedding vectors** encode semantic and contextual meanings, making them versatile for machine learning applications like recommendations.

### Task 3: Cluster Products Using K-means

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - **VectorAssembler** combines features for machine learning models in PySpark, simplifying feature preparation.
  - **K-means clustering** is an unsupervised algorithm that groups data points based on shared characteristics, making it ideal for product clustering.
